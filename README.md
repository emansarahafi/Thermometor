# Thermometor
A thermometer made with embedded C to detect the human body's temperature. The machine would buzz if the individual's body temperature were above 40 degrees Celsius to alert the concerned staff.
Embedded C programming language, Proteus, and EasyPIC v7 Development Board were used to implement this project from both software and hardware perspectives.
